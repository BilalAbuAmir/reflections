When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository when there is more than one working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? i dont know why

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a sort of clone that only apply on the github, where as actually clones are only apllyed on the local git, and branches are a sequentiel group of commits that relate to eachother.
